# deep-q-learning

I implemented the methods described in DeepMind's 2013 paper "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" in Keras for Tensorflow 

The minimal deep q-learning implementation described in [https://keon.io/deep-q-learning/](https://keon.io/deep-q-learning/) is modified for application to Atari Breakout.
